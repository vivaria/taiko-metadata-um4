# taiko-metadata

A repo for tracking changes to 'data.json' metadata files. These changes will be proposed for future UM/OM releases.

> **Note**: Personally, I primarily play 10* Oni songs, and so these songs will typically be where I discover (and fix) inaccuracies. But, these inaccuraries are likely to be present in other difficulties, too.

## Non-metadata issues

- [ ] Mekadesu.: Audio is very loud (relative to other songs).
- [ ] LECEIL GLISSANDO: Audio is loud, but also distorted/clipped-sounding. In particular, the bass drum beats sound crunchy and harsh compared to [sample Nijiro recordings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VK4NJGqOFbk).
