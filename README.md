# taiko-metadata

A repo for tracking changes to 'data.json' metadata files. These changes will be proposed for future UM/OM releases.

> **Note**: Personally, I primarily play 10* Oni songs, and so these songs will typically be where I discover (and fix) inaccuracies. But, these inaccuraries are likely to be present in other difficulties, too.

EDIT: UM5 has been released. This repo is now outdated, and so has been archived.
